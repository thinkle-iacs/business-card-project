## Overview

In this assignment, you'll create two business cards using HTML and CSS, showcasing your layout skills. The first card will utilize only **box model properties** for layout, while the second will use **Flexbox and Grid**.

Each card will represent an imaginary business of your choosing. This is your opportunity to get creative!

## Requirements

### Card 1: Box Model Layout

- Use only box model properties (e.g., `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `width`, `height`, etc.) for layout.
- No use of Flexbox or Grid.

### Card 2: Flexbox and Grid Layout

- Use **Flexbox** or **Grid** (or a combination) to design the layout.
- Demonstrate a different approach from the first card.
- See [example walk-throughs of flexbox layouts here](https://business-card-flex.netlify.app/)

### Honors Requirements:

- For _both_ cards, create a landscape and a portrait design (so you'll be doing 4 designs).
- Make use of at least one "border" trick to create a
  custom shape on the card. See [this page of
  cool css shape examples](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/)
- Include at least one "absolute positioned" element
  on the card using relative and absolute positioning.

### Design Elements for Both Cards

- Imaginary or real business with your own branding.
- Use a **custom font** (e.g., from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)).
- Include images that you either:
  1. Create yourself,
  2. Generate using AI, such as with [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/) (cite appropriately),
  3. Use from public domain or Creative Commons (cite sources).
- Make effective use of the key design principles we've discussed:
  - Contrast
  - Repetition
  - Alignment
  - Proximity
- Include at least 4 different elements with at least 2 levels of visual hierarchy
  (in other words: it has to be clear some elements, such as brand name, are more
  important than others, such as social media handles)
